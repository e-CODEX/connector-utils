/**
 * Represents a cron job that is scheduled and executed by Quartz. This class extends the
 * {@link QuartzJobBean} to leverage Quartz's job scheduling capabilities.
 *
 * <p>The core functionality of the CronJob includes setting the method to be invoked and the bean
 * on which the method is to be invoked. It also provides a mechanism to execute the given method on
 * the provided bean when the job is triggered.
 *
 * <p>The CronJob maintains a logger to offer trace level logging during the method invocation.
 * This helps in understanding what method on which bean is being invoked at runtime.
